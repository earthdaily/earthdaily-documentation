While you certainly want to take a closer look at the maps with high Change Index scores, you may also want to look for outliers. For example, during the key growth stage, you might see that most of your fields have a Change Detection score of 4. If there is a field with a Change Detection score of 1, you might want to look at the maps as it could be an indication that the field isn\u2019t growing as expected.</p> <p>Yesterday a field had a Change Index score of 8 but no score today \u2014 what is going on?</p> <p>Scores are only provided when maps are available within the 5 to 15 day threshold. So, if a score was provided based on a 15-day timespan yesterday and a new image was provided today, the only two images available for comparison are 16 days or 1 day apart.

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) An index derived from satellite imagery that measures vegetation health. Values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation. Emergence Date The date when the crop is first detected as emerging in the field, based on NDVI time series. Sowing Date The estimated planting date, calculated by subtracting a fixed number of days from the emergence date. ZARC Start/End Date The official start and end dates of the planting window defined by ZARC for a given crop, soil type, and cycle. ZARC Risk Level The level of climate risk associated with the planting window. Only returned when both soil type and cycle are specified. Status Indicates whether the detected sowing date falls within the legal ZARC planting window (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>). Soil Type Classification of soil used in ZARC to determine planting windows. Examples include ARENOSO, ARGILOSO, TEXTURA M\u00c9DIA, and AD1\u2013AD6. Cycle Refers to the crop variety duration: Short, Medium, or Long. Municipality Level The administrative level at which ZARC data is aggregated when soil type and/or cycle are not specified. WKT (Well-Known Text) A text markup language for representing vector geometry objects such as points, lines, and polygons. AOI (Area of Interest) The geographic area selected for analysis.
