## Well Know Text (WKT)
Well-known text (WKT) is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and transformations between spatial reference systems. 
In the request, the geometry information should be informed in WKT representation.  

As an example, the WKT of the geometry below is the following:

POLYGON((-93.49091102284739918 44.674440590846487,-93.48607158376363202 44.67442683709275997,-93.48557712387989227 44.68151532340738896,-93.49061357485479107 44.68154683380907244,-93.49091102284739918 44.674440590846487))

## ESPG code
EPSG codes are numerical codes associated with coordinate system definitions.
For example, the EPSG code: 4326 matches with WGS84 geographical projection.
