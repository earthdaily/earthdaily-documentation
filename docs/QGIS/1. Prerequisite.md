## 🌎 QGIS Plugin Prerequisites

QGIS (previously known as Quantum GIS) is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system (GIS) application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. You will find more information and latest packages available for download on [https://qgis.org](https://qgis.org). 


### Minimum Version Requirement
The GEOSYS® Plugin for QGIS has been tested with QGIS Release 3.2. Despite our efforts to maintain the plugin functionality, you might experience regression on further versions. For an optimal user experience, please do not use QHD screens or similar resolution.


### Authentication
GEOSYS® Plugin for QGIS is free and available to everyone, however data extraction and map display requires a user to have a valid account on the GEOSYS® platform. To get an account and try it out, please contact our support: Api.Support@Geosys.com and we will be pleased to guide you through the steps.
