# 🗺️ Get real-time crop classification at scale

## Introduction  
Traditionally, accurate and timely crop mapping has come at a high cost. Field surveys, farmer reports, and manual sampling methods provide precise data—but they are time-consuming, expensive to scale, and often lag behind the pace of market or agro-climatic events. By the time insights reach decision-makers, key opportunities may already be missed—or decisions are made without a full picture of what’s happening in the field. Today, that model is changing.

EarthDaily's Crop Classification product combines satellite imagery, weather data, and advanced AI models to accurately detect what crops are planted and where—all during the active growing season, at national scale.

This breakthrough enables a new standard of crop intelligence that is:  
- **Timely available** – Crop masks are provided during the growing season, not months after harvest  
- **Scalable** – Covering millions of hectares with consistent accuracy  
- **Cost-efficient** – Eliminating the need for large-scale field surveys  
- **Seamless** – Accessible through APIs and ready for integration into your business workflows  

Whether you are forecasting crop supply, managing agricultural risk, or optimizing procurement strategies, our solution brings unprecedented scale and efficiency to understanding what’s growing—across regions or entire countries.

## 🔧 Flexible Delivery to Fit Your Workflow  
Crop Identification is designed for seamless integration into your operations, offering two delivery mechanisms to match your needs:

- **API Access to Crop Mask Layers (via STAC Catalog)**  
Query spatially and temporally indexed crop masks through our API, fully referenced in a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC). Ideal for applications that require pre-processed crop masks over large areas in standard geospatial formats (e.g., GeoTIFF).

- **API Access to Field-Level Information**  
Retrieve crop type predictions linked to individual field boundaries, enabling precise, field-level intelligence. Suitable for systems that work with known field geometries. (Automated field boundaries is also available)

No matter your architecture or scale, our flexible delivery options make it easy to bring timely, accurate crop intelligence into your existing workflows.
