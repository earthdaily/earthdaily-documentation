## 📅 Historical Layers

To support long-term analysis, we provide historical crop classification layers starting from **2019**, leveraging public EU datasets. Centralizing all layers simplifies the analysis of crop rotations, land-use patterns, and annual changes, creating reliable historical coverage where none is available.

## 🔧 Flexible Delivery Options

Our product is designed for easy integration into your workflows, with two API-based delivery mechanisms:  

- **Crop Mask API (STAC):** Access spatially indexed, pre-processed crop maps in standard geospatial formats (GeoTIFF). Ideal for national or regional-scale analysis.  
- **Field-Level API:** Retrieve crop type predictions linked to known field boundaries for precision use cases at parcel level.  

Both options are scalable, reliable, and built to fit directly into your data pipeline.
