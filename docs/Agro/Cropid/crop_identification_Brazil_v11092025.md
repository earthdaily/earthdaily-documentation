## ⌛ In-Season Deliveries

To support timely decisions throughout the growing season, crop classification layers are delivered in **two stages per cropping cycle**. This phased approach provides progressively refined insights as new satellite and weather data become available.

**Delivery schedule:**  
- **Safra Season:** Early March and Early June  
- **Safrinha Season:** Early June and Early August  

Each delivery reflects the most recent satellite imagery and model outputs, ensuring increasing accuracy as the season progresses.

## 🎯 Model Performance

Our AI models deliver **high accuracy** for major row crops. Below are the typical **F1 score ranges** achieved under operational conditions:

- **Soybean:** > 0.95  
- **1st Corn (Safra):** 0.85 – 0.90  
- **2nd Corn (Safrinha):** 0.90 – 0.95  
- **Sugarcane:** 0.80 – 0.85  
- **Rice:** 0.85 – 0.90  
- **Cotton:** 0.60 – 0.70  
- **Wheat:** 0.85 – 0.90

## 🔧 Flexible Delivery Options

Our Crop Identification product is designed for seamless integration into your existing systems, with two delivery options via API:

- **Crop Mask API (STAC):** Access spatially indexed, pre-processed crop maps in standard geospatial formats such as GeoTIFF—ideal for large-area analysis.  
- **Field-Level API:** Retrieve crop type predictions linked to known field boundaries for precision use at the farm or parcel level.

Both options are scalable, reliable, and built to fit directly into your data pipeline.
