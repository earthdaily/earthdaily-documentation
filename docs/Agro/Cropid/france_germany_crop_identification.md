## In-Season Deliveries

Crop classification layers are delivered during the growing season, providing a good evaluation of winter crops and an early assessment of spring crops.  

**Delivery schedule:**  
- Mid-June  

Additional delivery dates can be added upon request. These in-season deliveries enable monitoring of planted areas, detection of acreage variations, and dynamic adjustment of supply and production forecasts.

## Model Performance

Our AI models deliver high accuracy across major crops in both France and Germany. Typical F1 score ranges under operational conditions are:

| France | Germany |
|--------|---------|
| Winter Wheat: 0.85-0.90 | Winter Wheat: 0.75-0.80 |
| Barley: 0.85-0.90 | Barley: 0.70-0.75 |
| Oil Seed Rape: >0.95 | Oil Seed Rape: 0.90-0.95 |
| Corn: 0.80-0.85 | Corn: 0.60-0.65 |
| Sunflower: 0.45-0.50 |  |
| Sugar Beet: 0.70-0.75 |  |

*Note: Spring crop detection such as sunflower is limited due to the earliness of the prediction.*

## Historical Layers

To support long-term analysis, we provide historical crop classification layers starting from **2019**, leveraging public EU datasets. Centralizing all layers simplifies the analysis of crop rotations, land-use patterns, and annual changes, eliminating the need to integrate multiple data sources.

## Flexible Delivery Options

Our product is designed for easy integration into your workflows, with two API-based delivery mechanisms:  

- **Crop Mask API (STAC):** Access spatially indexed, pre-processed crop maps in standard geospatial formats (GeoTIFF). Ideal for national or regional-scale analysis.  
- **Field-Level API:** Retrieve crop type predictions linked to known field boundaries for precision use cases at parcel level.  

Both options are scalable, reliable, and ready to integrate directly into your business systems.
