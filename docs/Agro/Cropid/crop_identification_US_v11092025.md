## Flexible Delivery Options

The product is designed for seamless integration into your workflows, with two API-based delivery mechanisms:

- **Crop Mask API (STAC):** Access spatially indexed, pre-processed crop maps in standard geospatial formats such as GeoTIFF—ideal for large-area analysis.  
- **Field-Level API:** Retrieve crop type predictions linked to known field boundaries for precision use at the farm or parcel level.  

Both options are **scalable, reliable, and built to fit directly into your data pipeline**.
