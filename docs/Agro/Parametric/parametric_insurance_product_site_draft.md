**📌 What is Parametric Insurance ?**

Parametric insurance is a **modern, data-driven approach** to insurance that provides **fast and transparent payouts** based on predefined triggers, such as:

- 🌧️ **Rainfall levels**
    
- 🌡️ **Temperature variations**
    
- 🌿 **Vegetation indices (NDVI)**
    

Unlike traditional indemnity-based insurance, which requires damage assessment, **parametric insurance automatically compensates farmers** when certain conditions are met. This means:

✅ **No lengthy claims process**  
✅ **Reduced administrative burden**  
✅ **Quick financial support after adverse weather events** (droughts, floods, storms, etc.)

The Parametric Data Service capability provides Actuaries and Data Scientists with high-quality environmental and agronomic data which enables them to create effective parametric indices in the agricultural insurance space.

EarthDaily Agro’s **Parametric Insurance API** provides seamless access to:

🔹 **Crop Specific Historical vegetation indices based on NDVI**  
🔹 **Historical High-Resolution Scientific-level weather data**

This API supports:  
🗺️ **Predefined geometries** (e.g., U.S. counties, Brazilian Municipios, French Communes…)  
📍 **Custom user-defined regions** (e.g., a specific farm in France or Brazil)

Insurers, agronomists, and financial institutions can offer innovative risk management solutions tailored to real-world agricultural challenges by leveraging Earth observation data.

🌍 **Indicators and coverage**

| **Indicator** | **Description** | **Temporal coverage** | **Geographical coverage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weather — Soil Moisture | High-resolution (9 km) global coverage with daily updates, providing advanced land  <br>surface modeling and observational data assimilation, for precise, consistent, and long-term records. | 2004 → Now | Globally |
| Weather — Precipitation | Our soil moisture data combines 2 high-resolution climate datasets with advanced modeling  <br>techniques (satellite imagery and ground truth data) to deliver accurate, global coverage at \~5 km resolution with frequent updates. | 2004 → Now | Globally |
| Vegetation (NDVI) | We Provide inter-calibrated Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on MODIS and Sentinel-3 acquisitions.  <br>We are currently preparing the launch of [EarthDaily Constellation](https://earthdaily.com/constellation/) which will provide a daily continuous stream of scientific-quality  <br>and analytics-ready data for even better accuracy. | 2004 → Now | Globally |
| NDVI Masking | We are providing a pure NDVI indicator, enabling data masking with classes like: combined vegetation, combined crops,  <br>specific crop type, or even pasture to better understand the global health status and vegetation conditions. We are constantly  <br>producing multiple accurate, before the Season, In-Season, and End of Season crop mask layers relying on internal scientific expertise and  <br>external official government data sources from USDA, “Agence de service et de paiement”,  <br>and Canadian Soil Information Service to make sure you have the most updated data. | 2004 → Now | Globally |
