## 🌾 In-Season Monitoring

Issuing a policy is just the beginning. Throughout the growing season, insurers face rising uncertainty – weather events, crop stress, and delayed sowing can all increase the risk of loss. Without timely insights, it’s easy to miss early warning signs.

That’s where satellite imagery and AI analytics come in – offering real-time, field-level visibility across your entire portfolio. Replace guesswork with actionable insights, and transform how you manage agricultural risk.

The **In-Season Monitoring** module enables insurers to detect early signs of crop underperformance and proactively engage discussions with growers.

Insurance decision-makers can access portfolio dashboards to gain a clear view of risk distribution across their entire book of business.

### Register Policies and Access In-Season Monitoring Results via API

Simply gather a few key details and register policies via API:

- Grower’s details (Firstname & Lastname)  
- Proposal details (ID, Date)  
- Field details (Name, Boundary, Approximative Sowing Date, Insured Crop)  

After an initial configuration, our In-Season Monitoring module automatically tracks your portfolio daily – spotting early signs of crop issues.

The system also supports previously submitted proposals – whether for historical assessment or compliance checks. If policy conversion data is shared, the in-season monitoring can run exclusively on accepted policies – keeping your insights relevant and targeted.

Up-to-date In-Season Monitoring analytics are seamlessly available – giving you the possibility to integrate real-time crop insights directly into your system.

## 📊 In-Season Monitoring Analytics

A set of analytics is generated for each policy and field in your portfolio – tracking key crop development stages to quickly identify policies that may require attention:

| **Analytics** | **Description** | **Technical details** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Planting Period Validation (ZARC)** | Assesses whether the sowing date falls within the legal planting window defined by Brazil’s Agricultural Climate Risk Zoning (ZARC) guidelines, identifying non-compliant practices. | [Learn more ](../Library/ZARC.md)|
| **Detected Emergence Date and Emergence Delay** | Confirms whether the crop has successfully emerged after planting and measures timing of emergence vs. historical averages. Delays may signal stress factors. | [Learn more ](../Library/Emergence.md) |
| **Detected Planted Area vs Declared Area (Planted Area Control)** | Identifies actual crop area via satellite and compares with farmer-declared area. Helps verify declarations and reduce fraud. | [Learn more ](../Library/) |
| **In-Season Potential Score** | Evaluates a field’s in-season performance using satellite imagery. Score of 50 = low, 70 = high. Ensures consistent and scalable risk assessment. | [Learn more ](../Library/In-season_Potential_Score.md) |
| **Relative Potential Score (vs History)** | Assesses if in-season performance is above or below historical trends for the same crop, identifying stress or underperformance. | [Learn more ](../Library/In-season_Potential_Score.md) |
| **Detected Harvest Date** | Identifies field harvest timing, marking end of insured period and status of claims. | [Learn more ](../Library/)|
