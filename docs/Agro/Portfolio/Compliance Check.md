# üõ°Ô∏è Compliance Check

With environmental regulations and sustainability standards tightening worldwide, insurers have a crucial role in ensuring the growers they support meet all legal and environmental requirements.

Compliance checks are no longer optional ‚Äì but manual, time-consuming processes make it tough to keep up, especially across large, diverse portfolios.

Whether you‚Äôre tracking land use, monitoring protected zones, or applying your own compliance rules, the Compliance Check module offers a scalable, objective, and customizable approach to evaluate growers' practices across your portfolio.


## üì§ Perform a Compliance Check for a New Proposal

![Compliance schema](../../assets/agro/portfolio-management/Compliance_schema.jpg)


### Input data

To perform a compliance check for a new proposal, the following information needs to be gathered and submitted through API:

- Grower‚Äôs details (Firstname & lastname; CPF number)
- Proposal details (ID, date)
- Field details (name, boundary, approximative sowing date, insured crop)

Once submitted, the API returns a Compliance Status for a given proposal.

The Compliance Status reflects the evaluation of all fields within the proposal. If any single field is flagged as non-compliant, the entire proposal is marked as non-compliant.  

**The Compliance Status** reflects the evaluation of all fields within the proposal.  
If any single field is flagged as non-compliant, the entire proposal is marked as non-compliant.

## üìä Visualize Compliance Check Results in  the App

In today‚Äôs landscape, environmental compliance is not just a regulatory requirement ‚Äî it's a strategic imperative.

As an addition to the Compliance API, our Environmental Compliance module empowers Brazilian users to effortlessly validate whether a specific geometry (such as a field, farm, policy area, or other land parcel) aligns with national environmental regulations.

With just a few clicks, users can identify and visualize overlaps with protected areas, including native lands, permanent preservation zones, and legal reserves. 

The user can either explore the fields in the interactive map or directly dive into the Policies and Fields tables.

![Compliance map](../../assets/agro/portfolio-management/Compliance_map_overview.png)

### Policies and Fields tables

Two different tabs / tables can be displayed: the **Policy Tab** and the **Field Tab**.

By default, the active tab is the Policy one, listing every policies and proposals and providing some compliance analytics aggregated at the policy level, while the Field tab displays all the fields.

On the bottom-right corner, the portfolio's total number of proposals is displayed. The data is updated automatically (for instance when filters are used).

### Access field analysis details

Once you have a global view of your field of interest, you'll be able to select the field you would like to look at. 

Fields colored in red (not compliant) or green (compliant) have already been analyzed (either through API only or directly in the App)

#### Require analysis for a given field
![Require field analysis](../../assets/agro/portfolio-management/Compliance_field_analysis_require.png)
Click on a grey field to perform analysis on it.

A panel will open on the right. Click on the "GENERATE" button on the bottom right of the panel. A loader will appear and your report will be generated in a few seconds, checking the potential overlap of your field with compliance layers.

![Compliance layers check](../../assets/agro/portfolio-management/Compliance_layers.png)


#### Visualize compliance results
Once a compliance analysis has been done on the field you can access all its detail through this right panel. It is divided in three sections :

* The first one allows you to get global information on your geometry (when you performed the analysis, where it is located, in which biome, is it part of legal amazon...)

![Compliance layers 2 ](../../assets/agro/portfolio-management/Compliance_layers_2.png)


* The second one allows you to get detail of each compliance item (the layers for which we check the overlap), with the associated detail (% of overlap if any). You can click on the display icon to see the features of the layer that intersect your geometry as well as visualizing the overlap in the map.

![Compliance layers 3 ](.../../assets/agro/portfolio-management/Compliance_layers_3.png)


* Eventually, the last one allows you to downloaded the PDF of your report with all previous information generated
