# Environmental Layers

## 📖 Overview

The **Environmental Layers** provide access to a comprehensive collection of geospatial datasets used by EarthDaily Agro to support environmental, agricultural, and compliance analyses in Brazil. Each dataset represents a specific environmental, regulatory, or land-use layer published by official national and state institutions (e.g., IBAMA (1), INCRA (2), ICMBio (3), SEMA (4), FUNAI). These layers can be queried individually or combined to identify overlaps with agricultural fields, farms, or other geometries — helping users assess legal compliance, conservation areas, and land management boundaries.

3.  --8<-- "../../glossary.md:icmbio"
4.  --8<-- "../../glossary.md:sema"

The datasets include CAR property boundaries, SIGEF and SNCI land registries, conservation units managed by ICMBio, embargo lists from IBAMA and state agencies (SEMA-MT, SIGA-GO, SIGA-MT, IAT-PR), and the LDI-PA deforestation list. These comprehensive layers enable thorough environmental compliance assessment and land-use analysis across Brazilian territories.

## 📋 Common Use Cases

### Environmental Compliance Checking

Query multiple layers to assess whether a property (1) overlaps with protected areas, embargoes, or indigenous lands:
{ .annotate }

1.  Properties can be identified using CAR, SIGEF, or SNCI registration data.

- **Conservation compliance**: Check overlap with ICMBio conservation units
- **Legal verification**: Cross-reference with IBAMA and state agency embargoes (SEMA-MT, SIGA-GO, SIGA-MT, IAT-PR)
- **Deforestation monitoring**: Verify against LDI-PA illegal deforestation list
- **Property validation**: Compare CAR boundaries with SIGEF and SNCI official registries

### Land Management Analysis

The INCRA-managed SIGEF and SNCI systems provide certified property boundaries that can be compared with CAR self-declared boundaries to identify discrepancies and ensure proper land registration.
