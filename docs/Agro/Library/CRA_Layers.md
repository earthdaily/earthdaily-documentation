# Environmental Layers

## 📖 Overview

The **Environmental Layers** provide access to a comprehensive collection of geospatial datasets used by EarthDaily Agro to support environmental, agricultural, and compliance analyses in Brazil. Each dataset represents a specific environmental, regulatory, or land-use layer published by official national and state institutions (e.g., IBAMA, INCRA, ICMBio, SEMA, FUNAI). These layers can be queried individually or combined to identify overlaps with agricultural fields, farms, or other geometries — helping users assess legal compliance, conservation areas, and land management boundaries.
