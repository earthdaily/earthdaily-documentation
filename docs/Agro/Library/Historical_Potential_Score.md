# Historical Potential Score


## üìñ Overview

The **Historical Potential Score** analytic provides an indicator of the average potential score over past years for a selected crop and season, based on cumulative NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). It serves as a benchmark to compare field performance across different areas within a region or across different years. A Risk Score is also provided based on the variability of the past seasons.

The figure below illustrates the expected NDVI development for a typical annual grain crop. The analytic transforms the NDVI time series into a potential score, enabling comparisons between fields in the same region or across historical seasons.

## üìú Rules for Defining Historical Periods

### If `historicalSeasons` is provided:
- If **3 or more years** are provided:
  - Use them directly to compute potential and risk scores.
- If **fewer than 3 years**:
  - If `year` is provided:
    - `start_year = year - 5`
    - `end_year = year - 1`
  - If `year` is not provided:
    - `end_year = max(historicalSeasons)`
    - `start_year = end_year - 4`

### If only `year` is provided:
- `start_year = year - 5`
- `end_year = year - 1`

### If neither is provided:
- A **ValueError** is raised.

## üìö Glossary

| **Term**                        | **Description** |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** | Index that measures vegetation health based on visible and near-infrared light reflectance. Values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating denser, healthier vegetation. |
| **MR / LR**                      | Image resolutions: **MR** (Medium Resolution) and **LR** (Low Resolution). Define the spatial detail level of the NDVI data used. |
| **Season Duration**              | Duration of the crop season, in days, used to calculate cumulative NDVI. |
| **Season Start Day / Month**     | Day and month marking the beginning of the crop season. Define the starting point for NDVI accumulation. |
| **Threshold Start**              | NDVI value used as a threshold to consider the start of relevant vegetative growth. |
| **Potential Score**              | Indicator of the productive potential of an area based on cumulative NDVI during the season. |
| **Average Potential Score**      | Mean of historical potential scores over the last five years. |
| **Olympic Mean**                 | Mean calculated by excluding the highest value and NaNs, used to reduce the impact of outliers. |
| **Standard Deviation**           | Measure of variability in historical potential scores. Higher values indicate greater uncertainty. |
| **Risk Score**                   | Risk index calculated as: (`Standard Deviation` / `Average`) √ó 100. Indicates the stability of potential over time. |
| **Season Break**                 | Boolean indicator showing whether a season's score was significantly below the historical average (less than 70% of the Olympic Mean). |
| **WKT (Well-Known Text)**        | Standard format for representing spatial geometries such as polygons, points, and lines. |
| **AOI (Area of Interest)**       | User-defined area for analysis. |
