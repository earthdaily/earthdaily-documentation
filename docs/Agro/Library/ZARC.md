# ZARC (Agricultural Zoning of Climate Risk)

## üìñ Overview

The **Agricultural Zoning of Climate Risk (ZARC)** is a policy tool that guides crop planting based on analyses of climate, soil, and crop cycles. Its goal is to reduce climate-related risks by identifying the best planting windows for each municipality. Easy to apply, it is widely used by farmers, financial agents, and policymakers.


**EarthDailyAgro‚Äôs ZARC analytic** evaluates whether crop planting occurred within the climate risk windows defined by Brazil‚Äôs Ministry of Agriculture. Leveraging satellite-based time series data, the analytic detects the crop‚Äôs emergence date in the field and compares it against the official risk zones established for the crop, location, and planting period.

### Business Logic Based on Query Parameters

The behavior of the **ZARC analytic** depends on the presence or absence of the `soil_type` and `cycle` query parameters:

#### Case 1: `soil_type` not provided
- The analytic retrieves ZARC data at the **municipality level**, filtered by **crop** and **cycle**.
- It returns the **earliest start date** and **latest end date** available for the selected crop-cycle combination.

#### Case 2: `cycle` not provided
- The analytic retrieves **summarized ZARC data** at the **municipality level**, filtered by **crop** and **soil_type**.

#### Case 3: Neither `soil_type` nor `cycle` provided
- The analytic retrieves **summarized ZARC data** at the **municipality level**, filtered only by **crop**.

---

### Risk Level Handling

- The `zarc_risk_level` output is only returned when both `soil_type` and `cycle` are specified.
- If either parameter is missing, the risk level is not included in the response.
- This ensures consistency, as risk levels are only meaningful when both soil and cycle are defined.

## üìö Glossary

|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **ZARC (Agricultural Zoning of Climate Risk)** | A strategic tool developed by Brazil‚Äôs Ministry of Agriculture to define safe planting windows for crops, based on regional climate risk, soil type, and crop cycle. |
| **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** | An index derived from satellite imagery that measures vegetation health. Values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation. |
| **Emergence Date**           | The date when the crop is first detected as emerging in the field, based on NDVI time series. |
| **Sowing Date**              | The estimated planting date, calculated by subtracting a fixed number of days from the emergence date. |
| **ZARC Start/End Date**      | The official start and end dates of the planting window defined by ZARC for a given crop, soil type, and cycle. |
| **ZARC Risk Level**          | The level of climate risk associated with the planting window. Only returned when both soil type and cycle are specified. |
| **Status**                   | Indicates whether the detected sowing date falls within the legal ZARC planting window (`true`) or not (`false`). |
| **Soil Type**                | Classification of soil used in ZARC to determine planting windows. Examples include ARENOSO, ARGILOSO, TEXTURA M√âDIA, and AD1‚ÄìAD6. |
| **Cycle**                    | Refers to the crop variety duration: Short, Medium, or Long. |
| **Municipality Level**       | The administrative level at which ZARC data is aggregated when soil type and/or cycle are not specified. |
| **WKT (Well-Known Text)**    | A text markup language for representing vector geometry objects such as points, lines, and polygons. |
| **AOI (Area of Interest)**   | The geographic area selected for analysis. |
