# Emergence Detection

## üìñ Overview

The **emergence detection analytic** identifies the begining of the crop development by analyzing time series of the vegetation index (NDVI). Using this data, it calculates both the growth rate and the acceleration of the NDVI curve. Emergence is detected when the NDVI exceeds a defined minimum threshold and demonstrates consistent, accelerating growth over a continuous period. The algorithm validates this behavior using predefined criteria and records the corresponding date as `EmergenceDate`. It also reports whether emergence was detected (`EmergenceStatus`) and which detection method was applied (`ConfirmationStatus`). The process is fast, robust, and adaptable to various crops and geographic regions.
