# In-season Potential Score

## üìñ Overview

The **In-season Potential Score**  analytic provides an indicator of the in-season potential score  in comparison to the past years, based on cumulative NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). It serves as a benchmark to compare field performance across different areas within a region or across previous years.

The figure below illustrates the expected NDVI development for a typical annual grain crop. The analytic transforms the NDVI time series into a potential score, enabling comparisons between fields in the same region or across historical seasons.

## Glossary

| **Term**                        | **Description** |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** | Index that measures vegetation health based on visible and near-infrared light reflectance. Values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating denser, healthier vegetation. |
| **MR / LR**                      | Image resolutions: **MR** (Medium Resolution) and **LR** (Low Resolution). Define the spatial detail level of the NDVI data used. |
| **Season Duration**              | Duration of the crop season, in days, used to calculate cumulative NDVI. |
| **Season Start Day / Month**     | Day and month marking the beginning of the crop season. Define the starting point for NDVI accumulation. |
| **Threshold**                    | NDVI value used as a cutoff to determine relevant vegetative activity. |
| **End Date**                     | Date until which the in-season NDVI is accumulated. |
| **Potential Score**              | Indicator of the productive potential of an area based on cumulative NDVI during the season. |
| **Historical Potential Score**   | Mean of potential scores from previous seasons. |
| **In-season Potential Score**    | Cumulative NDVI-based score for the current season up to the specified end date. |
| **Relative Potential Score**     | Ratio (in %) of in-season score to historical potential score. |
