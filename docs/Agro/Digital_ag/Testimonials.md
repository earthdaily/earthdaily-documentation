## 👥 Let Our Customers Speak for Themselves

### SOYL

> “The technology enhances our existing biomass imagery model so that growers using the service can receive regular, high-quality, cloud-free images throughout the key winter cereal nitrogen application window.”

SOYL is a leading precision crop production service provider. Based in the U.K., SOYL’s software technology is in use in more than 15 countries worldwide.

Poor weather can be a major challenge for satellite monitoring of crop growth. Cloud cover can obscure imagery, limiting growers’ access to essential information about crop development and performance.

The radar imagery designed by EarthDaily Analytics improved monitoring of SOYL's fields during periods of poor visibility. The radar model successfully passed a three-season test period with the company’s quality approval before full implementation.

To build on this success, SOYL also began utilizing **NDVI**, **CVI**, and automated **LAI** analytics from EarthDaily Agro to produce variable-rate maps based on scientifically adjusted models. To ensure quality, SOYL provides ground truth measurements each year to calibrate their model and adapt it to each season.
