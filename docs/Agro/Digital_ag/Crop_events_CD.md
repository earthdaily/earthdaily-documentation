## 🌱 Detection of Key Phenological Stages

Our phenology processors reliably detect key crop events, giving you a clear picture of each field’s progression through the season and how it compares to historical patterns:

- **Emergence detection** (historical, in-season, delay)
- **Greenness readiness** for peak-season assessments
- **Corn silking date** (calibrated for Europe)
- **Harvest readiness**
- **Harvest detection** (historical & in-season)

These insights eliminate guesswork, optimize scouting, and enable better planning across your entire portfolio.

## 🔍 Spatial Change Detection

Your fields are constantly changing across the growing season, and some shifts can be easy to miss. The Digital Ag Solution enables you to monitor these dynamics in near real time, helping you quickly identify fields with significant changes and prioritize where to visit first.

The **Change Detection** analytic highlights where conditions within a field are shifting—revealing early weak zones, emerging stress, and how in-field variability develops over time. This spatial insight allows you to detect issues sooner, understand their progression, and target interventions with greater precision.
