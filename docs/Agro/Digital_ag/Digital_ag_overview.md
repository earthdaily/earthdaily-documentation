# 🗺️ Digital Ag – Portfolio Monitoring 

## Introduction  
Agriculture is evolving, and growers now expect co-ops, input retailers, and service providers to deliver more than inputs — they are looking for holistic, data-driven support that helps them navigate agronomic, environmental, and economic challenges. Meeting these expectations requires deeper, more consistent insight into field performance than traditional scouting or experience alone can provide. 

At the same time, agronomists and advisors are responsible for supervising larger and more complex grower portfolios than ever before, making it increasingly difficult to provide precise, field-adjusted recommendations for every field of a farm. Distinguishing a field that is trending positively from one that is quietly declining is subtle, yet critical — and often impossible to assess without objective, standardized data. 

The Digital Ag solution addresses this need by delivering a clear, up-to-date view of every field in your portfolio. Through harmonized indicators, trend monitoring, and anomaly detection, it equips advisors with the evidence they need to guide growers with confidence, justify input adjustments, and intervene proactively when conditions begin to shift. 

The Digital Ag solution also serves as a foundational data layer for advanced analytics for Data Science Team. Its standardized, high-quality datasets feed seamlessly into modeling pipelines — enabling teams to build predictive tools, refine algorithms, and power the next generation of digital agriculture solutions.

## 👥 Capabilities
    1. Field Boundaries & Crop Identification 

    Accurate, up-to-date field boundaries and crop ID layers provide the foundation for consistent field-level analytics across large territories. 

    2. Field-Level Maps & Time Series 

    Harmonized vegetation, biomass, and crop-condition indicators are available as both maps and time series. This allows users to monitor crop conditions, track seasonal development, and understand historical trends. 

    3. Crop Events & Change Detection 

    Automated detection of key agronomic events—such as emergence, peak growth, and senescence—helps users track crop development with precision. Change-detection analytics highlight sudden or unexpected shifts in field behavior, supporting faster diagnosis of issues like stress, disease, or operational anomalies. 

    4. Field Benchmarking 

    Benchmarking tools compare each field against its own historical performance, similar fields in the portfolio, or regional trends. This contextual insight helps advisors assess whether a field is performing as expected, flag outliers, and prioritize interventions based on relative performance. 

    5. Decision-Support Tools 

Decision-support capabilities include generating management zones and prescription (Rx) maps for variable-rate input applications, as well as hotspot detection for guided scouting.  

## 🌎 Geographic Coverage and Crops  
The Digital Ag Solution leverages both public and private satellite constellations to ensure reliable, scalable coverage across agricultural regions worldwide.  

Our primary focus is on major raw crops such as cereals, oilseeds, and sugar crops, where consistent, field-level intelligence is essential for operational and modeling workflows. 

What sets us apart is our advanced, agriculture-specific cloud-masking technology, applied in targeted operational regions to ensure clean, reliable inputs for downstream analytics.  

In addition, all data sources are fully cross-calibrated to guarantee the spatial and temporal consistency of our analytics. Scalable processing, seamless integration, and consistent quality controls have been part of our business for more than 35 years.
