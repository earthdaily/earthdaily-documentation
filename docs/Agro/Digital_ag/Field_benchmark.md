# Analyzing Field Productivity (Year-over-Year Trends)

**See the big picture. Spot long-term shifts. Protect future yield.**  
Every season tells a story—yet without a consistent historical record, it is difficult to know whether a field is improving, declining, or deviating from its normal trajectory.

The Digital Ag solution enables you to track field performance against its own historical patterns using two key analytics: **Potential Score** and **Risk Score**.

## Potential Score (Historical & In-Season)

This analytic evaluates how a field performs during the growing season compared to its historical performance for the same crop. Using satellite imagery time series, it provides a simple, scalable indicator leveraging vegetation development as a proxy for yield potential.

- **Score of 50** → indicates low performance  
- **Score of 70** → indicates high performance  

With minimal inputs required, the Potential Score offers a consistent, repeatable way to benchmark field productivity across large portfolios.

## Risk Score

The Risk Score measures how stable or variable a field’s performance has been over time by analyzing fluctuations in its historical Potential Scores. It highlights underlying production risks that may not be visible in a single season.

- **Score of 20** → reflects stable, consistent yields  
- **Score of 65** → indicates significant variability and higher production risk  

These temporal benchmarks reveal anomalies, surface risks, and help identify management opportunities during the growing season.

# Field Benchmarking Makes Comparison Easy

## Field Benchmarking

The Digital Ag Solution helps you understand whether a field is behaving as expected by benchmarking it against neighboring fields under similar growing conditions. By comparing vegetation development across nearby fields, you can quickly identify growth anomalies, distinguish field-specific issues from regional trends, and prioritize where deeper investigation or intervention is needed.

## Field Ranking

The Field Ranking analytic compares the growth development of a defined set of fields, making it easy to identify top-performing fields and highlight those falling behind. By ordering fields based on their vegetation vigor, advisors can quickly see which fields require immediate attention and which are tracking as expected.

A complete, season-long intelligence layer that transforms how you monitor crop growth, compare field performance, and detect agronomic change. You will manage fields with more confidence than ever before.
