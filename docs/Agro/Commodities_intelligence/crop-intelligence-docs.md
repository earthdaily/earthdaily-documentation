- Vegetation and Weather Monitoring
- Historical Analog Detection
- Historical Dataset Comparison

## Success Cases 🔗

Over time we will create pages for key success cases and our most recent "accuracy" stats

### Planned Case Studies:
- 2023 and 2024 Accuracy Docs
- 2022 Brazil Soybeans

### 2024 Russian Winter Wheat Case Study

**Extremely wet start of the cycle**

![Wet start conditions](../../assets/agro/commodities_intelligence/Picture5.png)

**Record dry conditions in the following months**

![Dry conditions](../../assets/agro/commodities_intelligence/Picture6.png)

**Strong late cold snap in May**

![May cold snap](../../assets/agro/commodities_intelligence/Picture7.png)

**Warm waves at the end of the cycle negatively rushing the grain maturation**

![End of cycle warm conditions](../../assets/agro/commodities_intelligence/Picture8.png)

Weather insights and some analogies with the very poor 2012 crop vigor allowed us to forecast very disappointing winter wheat yields 11 weeks before USDA did!
