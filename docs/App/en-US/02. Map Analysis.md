When comparing two maps there is a third legend option "Comparison".  
The Comparison legend will have green for the highest value and red for the lowest value when looking at all pixels on both maps.

## Simple zoning

You can easily highlight zones on your map.

> By clicking directly on the legend, the corresponding area is highlighted on the map. Multiple legend ranges can be selected at the same time.

> You can also decide to display a specific number of zones on your map using the zoning option at the bottom right of your screen.

> The generated zones can be downloaded. Click on the download button in the top bar when the zones are displayed.

## Management zones

For more advanced zoning capabilities, you can use our zone management option. This zoning involves selecting several image dates and a number of zones. Then, all image data will be analyzed to associate the pixels closest to each other.

> To do this, select the images of interest directly in the carousel. A "+" button is available, allowing you to add your images to the cart (visible in the top bar).

> Once your selection is complete, go to the cart and click on "create a zoning map". A new page will open for you to configure your map. You will need to give it a name a to select the number of zones you want.

> Your management zone map has now been created. You can retrieve it at any time by accessing the management section in the left-hand menu.

## Rx maps (variable rate application)

> In precision agriculture, variable rate application refers to the application of a material, such that the rate of application is based on the precise location, or qualities of the area that the material is being applied to. In Map Analysis module you can do such preconisation map based on any imagery products you have available, such as management zones maps, or simple zoning maps based on vegetation, soil, or elevation.
