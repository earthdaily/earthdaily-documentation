## 🌍 Overview

The Earth Daily web application utilizes a Home Page that provides a quick view of key analytics and multiple Modules which allow the user to deep dive on specific analytics at different aggregation levels. Multiple views can be toggled to show different analytics at different times of the season in order to respond to crop and weather conditions quickly.
