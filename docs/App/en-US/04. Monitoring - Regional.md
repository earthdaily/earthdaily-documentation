## Favorite Maps

If you have a Regional Monitoring Map that you frequently visit you can save it as a Favorite so you do not need to select the Block, Mask and Analytic information each time you want to access the map.  
> Once you have created the map you will need to click on the Star icon located in the top right of the screen.
