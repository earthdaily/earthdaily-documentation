## 📌 Favorite Maps

If you have a Regional Monitoring Map that you frequently visit you can save it as a **Favorite** so you do not need to select the Block, Mask and Analytic information each time you want to access the map. Once you have created the map you will need to click on the **Star** icon located in the top right of the screen.
