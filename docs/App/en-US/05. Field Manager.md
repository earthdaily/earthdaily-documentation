## 🌱 Field Manager

The **Field Manager** module is used to create and edit fields to get maps and insights in the Geosys app.

## 🔧 Create New Fields

To **Create** a new field, click on the + icon in the Mapping toolbar.

This will open the Field Creation toolbar where you use various field creation tools:

- **Draw polygon**: click to make segments outlining a polygon to create a field.
- **Draw circle**: click to select the centroid and stretch a circle to outline a field.
- **CLU**: in some regions, you can select the CLU (Common Land Unit) layer to choose your field. Select one or more CLUs to define the extent of your field.
- **Automatic boundary**: if you have subscribed to the Automatic Boundary service, you can retrieve delineated field boundaries by clicking on the target field. Please note that the Automatic Boundary service is only available in some regions (US, India, Brazil, Europe). If you use it in a region where it is not available, the message "This zone is not covered" will be displayed and the field boundaries will not be retrieved.
- **Paste**: Paste a field shape you copied before (wkt or geojson format)

After using successfully the Automatic boundary service, the field boundaries will be displayed on the screen.

After drawing or selecting the field you can edit the boundaries by dragging the nodes.  

> To add a new node to the boundary, click on the line itself and drag to the desired location.  

> When the boundary is complete, click the validate icon in the Field Creation toolbar.

Once the border is validated you will be able to enter the Field Information such as:
- Grower,
- Farm Name,
- Field Name,
- Crop,
- Usage (not mandatory),
- Irrigation Status (not mandatory),
- Sowing Date

### Edit Field Details

Select a Field and you will see the Field Information panel on the right side of the screen.  
This panel allows you to edit things such as the Field Name, Crop Type, Usage, Irrigation Status and Sowing Date.  
You can also manage the field’s subscriptions (Ex: Benchmark, Change Index).

### Bulk Edit Field Details

It is possible to select/edit multiple fields by holding the Ctrl key and clicking on all the fields you wish to edit.  
The Field Information panel options will shrink to display only the parameters which are editable when multiple fields are selected.
