## 🚩 Compliance Analysis

Today environmental compliance services play a relevant role in the search for the preservation of the environment, in addition to protecting companies from financial and reputational risks. This module enables Brazilian customers to quickly check whether or not a given geometry (field, farm, policy or other) complies with environmental and national legislation. It is used to confirm that there is no overlap between the geometry and protected areas such as native land, permanent protection areas, legal reserves, etc.

## 📑 Portfolio Analysis

This module allows the user to navigate through their portfolio, launch compliance analyses, and quickly identify the geometries (fields, farm, policies...) at risk.  In the **Compliance module**, as in the other modules, the selection panel will display by default all Growers/Farms which have at least one field in the current season. Click on the Filter icon to open otions which will allow you to make selections shorten the Grower/Farm list based on In-Season or Sowing Date range, Crop Type, Usage and/or Irrigation Status.<br/>

Then, select one or many Growers/Farms and see all the fields in either a Map or Grid view. To toggle between the two views click on the map or list icon in the upper right of the screen.

### View Compliance Results

Once a compliance analysis has been done on the field you can access all its detail through this right panel.
It is divided in three sections:

- The first one allows you to get global information on your geometry (when you performed the analysis, where it is located, in which biome, whether or not is it part of legal Amazon...)

<br/>

- The second one allows you to get detail of each compliance item (the layers for which we check the overlap), with the associated detail (% of overlap if any). You can click on the display icon to see the features of the layer that intersect your geometry.

- The third allows you to downloaded the PDF of your report with all previous information generated.
